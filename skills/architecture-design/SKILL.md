# Architecture Design

## Focus

- interface clarity
- dependency direction
- coupling and ownership
- migration safety
- failure modes

## Workflow

1. Inspect existing boundaries first.
2. Define the minimum interface or contract change needed.
3. List compatibility constraints and migration implications.
4. Prefer the smallest structural change that resolves the ambiguity.
5. Specify verification for both the happy path and the failure path.
